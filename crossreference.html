                I appreciate the organization of TRU's university website, finding it easy to navigate 
                and intuitive. <br>UBC's website stands out for its flexibility, smoothly adapting to different 
                screen sizes. MIT's website is compact, presenting information without unnecessary details.</dd><br>

                user-friendly, allowing easy navigation and download of the needed mp3. YouTube offered a user-friendly API that 
                generated a usable link for my HTML.</dd><br>
